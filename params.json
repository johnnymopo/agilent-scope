{"name":"Agilent-scope","tagline":"Python for Agilent oscilloscope, no visa required, just simple SCPI and sockets","body":"agilent_scopy.py was created quickly for use with an Agilent MSO6104A during a radar field project.  It is pretty much limited to the use I needed but you should find it a good starting point.  The class uses SCPI over Ethernet to collect channel data without a visa object.  It uses a simple TCP socket on port 5025 and relays commands using textual SCPI.\r\n\r\nIf there is interest in developing a library further, please contact me at john.m.mower@gmail.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
